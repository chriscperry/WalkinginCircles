Walking in Circles is an interactive narrative / adventure 
where you play as a bird on a quest to find an ancient monument
in a hyperbolic forest. It might take some time to get used to
walking around in this forest, as the dimensions are x, y, 
theta, and chapter. This is very different from both the world
we live in, and the two dimensional projection of the isometric
map that we can see of it. 

Written and designed by Chris Perry, and produced by Chris Perry.

A special thanks to Professors Anil Ada and David Kosbie, 
and to Becca and all the CA's who helped make this happen
